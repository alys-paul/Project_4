# üõçÔ∏è Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation & Product Recommendation

## üìÇ Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing customer transaction data from an e-commerce platform to derive actionable insights using RFM analysis, customer segmentation, and collaborative filtering. The solution includes a Streamlit app that delivers real-time customer segmentation and product recommendations based on user input.

## üìà Streamlit App Features

### üéØ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Product Recommendation Module

* **Objective**: Suggests 5 similar products based on purchase history.
* **How It Works**:

  * User enters a product name.
  * The app uses cosine similarity on a customer-product quantity matrix.
  * Top 5 similar products are displayed.

### üß† 2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation Module

* **Objective**: Categorizes a customer into a behavior-based segment.
* **How It Works**:

  * User inputs: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
  * The app applies StandardScaler ‚Üí PCA ‚Üí KMeans to predict the cluster.
  * Outputs the interpreted customer segment (e.g., High-Value, At-Risk).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the App

1. ‚úÖ Install required packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

2. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run pr_recommendation.py
```

## üîç Behind the Scenes

* **Clustering**:

  * Features: Recency, Frequency, Monetary
  * Scaled using StandardScaler
  * Dimensionality reduced using PCA (2 components)
  * Clustered using KMeans (4 clusters)
  * Interpreted using RFM averages & ranked scoring

* **Recommendations**:

  * Built using item-based collaborative filtering
  * Cosine similarity computed on product purchase matrix (CustomerID √ó Product)
